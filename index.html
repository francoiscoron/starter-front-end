                        <h2>The bedding was hardly able to cover it.</h2>
                        <p>One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled
                        dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into
                        a horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back,
                        and if he lifted his head a little he could see his
                        brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into
                        stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover
                        <strong>strong</strong> it and seemed ready to slide
                        off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin
                        compared with the size of the rest of him,
                        <a class="external ext" href="#">link</a> waved about
                        helplessly as he looked. "What's happened to me? " he
                        thought. It wasn't a dream. His room, a proper human
                        room although a little too small, lay peacefully
                        between its four familiar walls.</p>

                        on the table.</h3>
                        <p>It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur
                        boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff that
                        covered the whole of her lower arm towards the
                        viewer.</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            Gregor then turned to look out the window at the dull
                            weather. Drops of rain could be heard hitting the pane,
                            which made him feel quite sad. "How about if I sleep a
                            little bit longer and forget all this nonsense", he
                            thought, but that was something he was unable to do
                            because he was used to sleeping on his right, and in
                            his present state couldn't get into that position.
                            However hard he threw himself onto his right, he
                            always rolled back to where he was.
